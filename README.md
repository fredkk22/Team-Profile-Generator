## Description

This Module 10 Challenge was to create a professional team profile generator that could be used in the workplace.

The reason for creating this challenge was to learn more about Node.js, the inquirer package, command line applications, and test-driven development.

I was able to learn everything I listed above, and hope that I am able to continue learning more about test-driven development, as I think it is a great way of solving bugs in one's own code.

## Video Recording

Due to the fact that the Team Profile Generator is not a deployed application, I recorded the Team Profile Generator in action.
